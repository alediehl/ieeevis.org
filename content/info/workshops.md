The role of visualization in artificial intelligence (AI) gained significant attention in recent years. With the growing complexity of AI models, the critical need for understanding their inner-workings has increased. Visualization is potentially a powerful technique to fill such a critical need.

The goal of this workshop is to initiate a call for "explainables" / "explorables" that explain how AI techniques work using visualization. We believe the VIS community can leverage their expertise in creating visual narratives to bring new insight into the often obfuscated complexity of AI systems.

Often the most transformative ideas and challenges come from unexpected and serendipitous sources. Yet, conferences are not often perceived as a place for non-traditional, controversial, or outré work. We propose to continue the success of last year's "alt.VIS" workshop that borrows from the long-running and successful "alt.chi" model from the ACM SIGCHI conference; once again providing an avenue for surfacing work that would otherwise not find a home through the standard VIS conference review process.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing biomedical science in many ways, from improving image-based diagnostics to identifying new drugs. Effective visualization can significantly improve the communication between AI systems and human users and is playing an increasingly important role in biomedical AI. However, visualization in biomedical AI is highly interdisciplinary and a mutual understanding is still missing across disciplines.

The aim of this workshop is to explore the challenges and opportunities in this highly interdisciplinary research by bringing together researchers from data visualization, biomedical informatics, machine learning, and computational biologists. We hope this workshop can 1) attract more research interest from the VIS community to this newly emerging topic by showcasing successful applications and promising directions for using visualization in biomedical AI studies and 2) demonstrate the importance of design and share good visualization practices to biomedical AI researchers and broaden the impact of visualization research.

## <a name="viscomm"></a> [Fifth Workshop on Visualization for Communication (VisComm)](https://viscomm.io/)

While the visualization field consists of researchers exploring how people perceive information and different data visualization tools and platforms, there is an even larger community of analysts, practitioners, and organizations who are creating data and information visualizations and communicating their work every day. The challenges these groups face in communicating their work are often distinct from the research taking place in the academic community.

The VisComm workshop brings together practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines to address questions raised by the new and evolving role of data visualization in our everyday lives. We encourage participation from journalists, designers, practitioners, health communicators, and others who do not typically attend IEEE VIS. This year, we will kick things off a panel on the future of data visualization with Mike Bostock, Sheelagh Carpendale, Jessica Hullman, and Duncan Geere.

Communicating climate science to the general public is necessary to enhance salience, understanding, and engagement and to accelerate action. Visualizations of climate data offer an integral way of communicating climate change findings to diverse audiences; however it is challenging due to the multi-dimensionality of data, the complexity of science, the diversity of users, their biases, and needs across different stakeholder groups. While graphics support thinking and enhance storytelling, creating data visualizations of climate data that can overcome comprehension difficulties, avoid misconceptions, preserve scientific integrity, and instill trust remains a challenge. This half-day workshop aims to establish a community of practice around data-driven visual climate science communication and in so doing address one of the grand challenges in our era. The workshop seeks to define what ‘high impact’ means in the domain of climate science communication, and to unpack the techniques, methods, and challenges for achieving it. The mission is to pull expertise from within IEEE Vis, bridge the gap between research and practice, and others who typically do not attend the conference, share lessons learned, identify directions for research, foster collaborations, and understand where and what we should do better as a community of practice.

There are many ways that work in visualization can have immediate social impact— working closely with community stakeholders, exploring how to present data for mass audiences, evaluating the potential of visualization for advocacy or as a tool to shape public policy— all have the potential to reshape society for the better. Thoughtfulness, reflection, and critique are likewise important to build up a clear picture of both the potential benefits and potential harms of visualization research.

The Visualization for Social Good Workshop (Vis4Good) aims to provide a central venue within the IEEE VIS community for surfacing work that critiques, defines, or explores the impact of data visualization on society. Through a blend of paper sessions, invited presentations, and break-out groups, we hope that the inaugural Vis4Good 2022 Workshop encourages attendees to harness visualization research to tackle critical challenges in responsible AI, clean energy, human health and well-being, and other domain areas with critical societal impact.

Testing hardware, software, and other products is a highly relevant task to ensure quality and reliability. Due to the increasing complexity of such systems or products, testing tasks are not only an inevitable step that can occur at different stages of product life cycles, but they are getting increasingly complex as well. Such tasks include among others: test planning, defining tests and test data, carrying out test plans, as well as collecting and analyzing test results. Monitoring and profiling tasks are added when later phases in the life cycle of systems and products are taken into account. All these different tasks need to scale with an increasing number of tests conditions, parameters, test samples, boundary conditions, etc., and with more sophisticated analysis methods including AI-based approaches.

While the visual representation of test results is not uncommon, interactive steering has the potential to advance test processes at different stages in a system’s or product’s life cycle. Interactive visualization can support test practitioners to cope with inherent complexity, e.g., by helping to orchestrate complex test procedures and analyses.

Currently, there is a gap between industry practice in testing and visualization research. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different domains where testing is relevant. We see it as a first step toward building a community of stakeholders from industry and academia interested in visualizing test and monitoring-related problems. To achieve this gaol, the workshop will start a discussion on intrinsic problems of different test procedures to improve the understanding of differences and commonalities in different domains. In addition, we would like to collect examples for supporting test tasks visually and to discuss which testing problems can benefit from interactive visualization. By gathering examples and research approaches from this area, we aim to collect best practices that will serve as the basis for setting up a research agenda.
